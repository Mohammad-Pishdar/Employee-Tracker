  ## Description
  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this app we try to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
